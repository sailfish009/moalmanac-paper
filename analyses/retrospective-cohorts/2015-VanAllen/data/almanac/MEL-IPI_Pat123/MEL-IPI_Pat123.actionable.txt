Investigate Actionability - High	Clinical evidence			Somatic Variant	GATA3	Missense	p.S438N	0.3793	116.0	0.0	0.0		Investigate Actionability - High	Letrozole	Targeted therapy	GATA3 mutation did not influence baseline Ki67 levels but was enriched in samples exhibiting greater percentage of Ki67 decline. While this requires further validation, it suggests that GATA3 mutation may be a positive marker for aromatase inhibitor response.	Ellis MJ, Ding L, Shen D, et al.
