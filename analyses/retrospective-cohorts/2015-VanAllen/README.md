# 2015 Van Allen
We evaluated 110 patients with metastatic melanoma for clinical actionability based on the Molecular Oncology Almanac and compared findings relative to PHIAL and TARGET. Tumor and normal whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq were processed on the Broad Institute and Verily's [Terra platform](https://app.terra.bio/) that sits atop Google Cloud. 

Outputs, without germline, can be downloaded using the `download-from-terra.ipynb` jupyter notebook, located in the above directory. Files will be deposited into the `data/` folder.
