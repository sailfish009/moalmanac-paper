Nat Med. 2010;16(7):793-8.	https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.2166							Investigate Actionability - Low	0.0	A cohort of men with localized prostate cancer was followed and a statistically significant association between the presense of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and prostate cancer specific death was observed. Prostate cancer with this fusion may be of a more aggressive phenotype.	Demichelis F, Fall K, Perner S, et al.
