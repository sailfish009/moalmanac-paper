Investigate Actionability - Low	FDA-Approved	Clinical evidence		Somatic Variant	BRCA2	Frameshift	p.Q2157fs*18						Investigate Actionability - Low	Olaparib	Targeted therapy	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for olaparib for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA-mutated advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

Investigate Actionability - Low	Clinical evidence		Inferential	Somatic Variant	PALB2	Nonsense	p.E180*						Investigate Actionability - Low	Platinum	Chemotherapy	When present alongside genomic instability, defined by a large number of structural variation events, the inactivation of DNA maintenance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2) was associated with increased sensitivity to platinum therapy in pancreatic cancer patients.

Investigate Actionability - Low		Clinical evidence		Somatic Variant	ESR1	Missense	p.Y537S												Investigate Actionability - Low	Tamoxifen + Letrozole	Combination therapy	Nonsynonymous mutations in ESR1 were found in metastatic breast cancer patients that developed resistance to endrocrin therapy. These patients were treated with anti-estrogens (taxmoxifen and/or fulvestrant) and aromataste inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole, and/or exemestane).	Robinson DR, Wu YM, Vats P, et al.
