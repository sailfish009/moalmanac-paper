Putatively Actionable	Clinical trial	Guideline	Guideline	Somatic Variant	BRAF	Missense	p.V600E						Putatively Actionable	Vemurafenib + Cetuximab	Targeted therapy	Vemurafenib alone had insufficient activity in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer patients. Of patients who received vemurafenib and cetuximab, one response was observed; however, approximately half of the patients had tumor regression that did not meet the standard criteria of partial response.
