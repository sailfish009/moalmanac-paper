Investigate Actionability - Low		Clinical evidence		Somatic Variant	ESR1	Missense	p.D538G												Investigate Actionability - Low	Tamoxifen + Letrozole	Combination therapy	Nonsynonymous mutations in ESR1 were found in metastatic breast cancer patients that developed resistance to endrocrin therapy. These patients were treated with anti-estrogens (taxmoxifen and/or fulvestrant) and aromataste inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole, and/or exemestane).	Robinson DR, Wu YM, Vats P, et al.
