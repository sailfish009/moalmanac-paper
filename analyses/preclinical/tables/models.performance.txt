This is a proxy for mutational burden, because we do not have the number of somatic bases considered when calling variants to use a denominator.

One issue with agreement based measure is that each feature is weighted the same. CELLector has a sorted list of genes/variants based on cancer type and will report similar cell lines based on mutant / wild type status of each gene. While not exactly the same, we use the annotations from various datasources appended to variants by the Molecular Oncology Almanac to create a priority list for variants (hotspots ranked the highest, etc.). For each case sample, we consider the genes which are observed to be mutated and preserve the order that they would appear in the somatic.scored.txt output of Molecular Oncology Almanac. All other samples are then sorted by their mutant / wild type status of these genes.
